shopping_list_project
=====================

I made this project during Thinkful.com's front-end developer course.

This project demonstrates ability in jQuery/Javascript to:
* get keyboard input from a user (and store in browser)
* register mouse click events
* add/remove elements from the DOM
* apply style changes using CSS classes on mouse events
